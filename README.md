# Pebble Outlook Calendar
This is an app for Pebble smartwatch, created using PebbleJS.
It retrieves Outlook events using Office365 APIs, caches them and displays them as a list, which you can browse and see details of each event.
Every time when you enter the app, it tries to update the list. Even if update is not successful, for example you don't have internet connection or even if the watch is disconnected from the phone altogether, you will still be able to browse the list of events offline.
