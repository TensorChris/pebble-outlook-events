# Events 365

This is an app for Pebble smartwatch. It doesn't require a companion app.

It retrieves Outlook events using Office365 APIs and displays them as a list, which you can then browse and see details of each event. Events are cached so they can also be browsed offline, even when watch is not connected to the phone.

Additionally, if you're late to a meeting, you can reply with an "I'm being late" message. In this case you can select approximate delay and send the message:

The message is configurable.
