# Pebble Outlook Calendar

This is an app for Pebble smartwatch, created with Pebble.js. It doesn't require a companion app.

It retrieves Outlook events using Office365 APIs, caches them and displays them as a list, which you can then browse and see details of each event. Events can also be browsed offline (i.e. when your phone is not connected to internet).
